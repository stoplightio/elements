# Elements Angular Example

Important files:

- [src/index.html](./src/index.html): The elements library is loaded in this file. This makes the `SL` global variable available for use.
- [src/app/docs/docs.component.html](./src/app/docs/docs.component.html): These are the HTML elements that we render the elements into.
- [src/app/docs/docs.component.ts](./src/app/docs/docs.component.ts): This file uses the elements library to render a table of contents, and page component onto the screen. It also hooks up the navigation to the angular router.
