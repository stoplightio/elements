## Introduction to Elements Dev Portal

Elements comes in two flavours, the basic package which only covers a single API, and Elements Dev Portal, which is backed by Stoplight Platform and can do many many things. 

- Support multiple APIs
- Markdown Articles
- [Hosted Mock Server](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/platform/3.-design/d.setting-up-a-mock-server.md) Integration
- Version Selector (Multiple Branches)
- Powerful Search

> The Dev Portal can only be tested on local host using the free plan. Please upgrade to starter or above to use it in a production environment.

Think of the dev portal as more of a Content Management System, focused entirely on making an awesome developer experience for an organization. 

Just like the Elements API component, it is available as a Web Component or a React component.
