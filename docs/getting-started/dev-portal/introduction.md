## Introduction to Elements Dev Portal

Elements Dev Portal is backed by the [Stoplight Platform](https://stoplight.io/) and offers: 

- Support for multiple APIs
- Markdown article rendering
- [Hosted mock servers](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/platform/3.-design/d.setting-up-a-mock-server.md)
- Version selector (multiple branches)
- Powerful search

## Stoplight Platform

Elements Dev Portal can be used for free during development on your local machine. To use the Dev Portal in a production environment, [subscribe to a paid plan](https://stoplight.io/pricing).

The Elements Dev Portal must be connected to [a public project](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/platform/be67e532b4b2a-manage-project-access#change-project-visibility) in the Stoplight Platform. A ‘Forbidden’ error occurs if the project visibility isn't set to Public.
