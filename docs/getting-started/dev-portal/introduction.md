## Introduction to Elements Dev Portal

Elements Dev Portal is backed by the [Stoplight Platform](https://stoplight.io/) and can do many things. 

- Support multiple APIs
- Markdown Articles
- [Hosted Mock Server](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/platform/3.-design/d.setting-up-a-mock-server.md) Integration
- Version Selector (Multiple Branches)
- Powerful Search

> Elements Dev Portal can be used for free during development on your local machine. If you need to use it in a production environment, [subscribe to a paid plan](https://stoplight.io/pricing).
