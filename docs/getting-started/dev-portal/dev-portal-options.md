# Dev Portal Configuration Options

- `projectId` - Find the Project ID in the Project Settings screen on Stoplight.
- `platformUrl` - By default this is `https://stoplight.io/` and this default will be fine for most people. Some enterprise customers might need to change it.
- `basePath` - Helps when using `router: 'history'` but docs are in a subdirectory like `https://example.com/docs/api`.
- `collapseTableOfContents` - Pass `true` to stop the table of contents expanding folders of articles and showing lists of endpoints for an API. This will clean up the ToC if you have a lot of content.
- `hideMocking` - Pass `true` to disable all mocking options and remove mention of the mock server.
- `hideTryIt` - Pass `true` to hide the "Try It" panel (the interactive API console).
- `tryItCorsProxy` - Pass the URL of a CORS proxy used to send requests to TryIt. The provided url is prepended to the URL of an actual request.
- `router` -  Determines how navigation should work:
  - `history` - (Default) Uses the HTML5 history API to keep the UI in sync with the URL.
  - `hash` - Uses the hash portion of the URL (i.e. window.location.hash) to keep the UI in sync with the URL.
  - `memory` - Keeps the history of your "URL" in memory (does not read or write to the address bar).
  - `static` - Renders using the StaticRouter which can help rendering pages on the server.
