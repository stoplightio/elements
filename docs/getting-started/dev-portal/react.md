# Elements Dev Portal in React

Learn how to quickly get started with Elements Dev Portal in a React project.

## Usage

1. First, install the elements-dev-portal package with NPM/Yarn.

```bash
yarn add @stoplight/elements-dev-portal
```

2. In `App.js` import the API component and CSS file from the Elements library.

```jsx
import { StoplightProject } from '@stoplight/elements-dev-portal';
import '@stoplight/elements-dev-portal/styles.min.css';
```

3. Find the "Project ID" from the Project Settings view of your Stoplight Project.

4. Now you can replace the existing App component's contents with the StoplightProject component.

```jsx
<StoplightProject projectId="cHJqOjYyNTgw" />
```

Now your `App.js` file should look something like this:

<!-- title: App.js -->
```jsx
import React from 'react';

import { StoplightProject } from '@stoplight/elements-dev-portal';
import '@stoplight/elements-dev-portal/styles.min.css';


function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <StoplightProject projectId="cHJqOjYyNTgw" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Fire it up

Now start the development server.

```bash
yarn start
```

And you should see the API reference documentation for the Zoom API!

## Configuration

- `projectId` - Find the Project ID in the Project Settings screen on Stoplight.
- `platformUrl` - By default this is `https://stoplight.io/` and this default will be fine for most people. Some enterprise customers might need to change it.
- `basePath` - Helps when using `router: 'history'` but docs are in a subdirectory like `https://example.com/docs/api`.
- `hideMocking` - Pass `true` to disable all mocking options and remove mention of the mock server.
- `hideTryIt` - Pass `true` to hide the "Try It" panel (the interactive API console).
- `layout` - There are two layouts for Elements:
  - `sidebar` - (default) Three-column design.
  - `stacked` - Everything in a single column, making integrations with existing websites that have their own sidebar or other columns already.
- `router` -  Determines how navigation should work:
  - `history` - (default) uses the HTML5 history API to keep the UI in sync with the URL.
  - `hash` - uses the hash portion of the URL (i.e. window.location.hash) to keep the UI in sync with the URL.
  - `memory` - keeps the history of your "URL" in memory (does not read or write to the address bar).
