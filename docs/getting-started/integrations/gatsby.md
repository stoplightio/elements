# Using Elements in GatsbyJS

## Gatsby Starter

We've created a [Gatsby Starter for Stoplight Elements](https://github.com/stoplightio/gatsby-starter-elements), which allows you to create a brand new Elements website in Gatsby without any additional setup.

```bash
npx gatsby new my-dir https://github.com/stoplightio/gatsby-starter-elements
```

Then run `cd my-dir` and `npm run start` and you will see a basic Elements website in the browser.
