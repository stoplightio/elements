# Stoplight Elements

Elements is an API Documentation toolkit leveraging [OpenAPI](https://openapis.org/) and Markdown ([CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)) to provide beautiful, interactive API reference documentation that you can integrate with any existing content-management system or single-page application. 

Elements is made by [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=elements&utm_campaign=docs), which offers hosted documentation, visual API design tools, and other handy API tooling. You don't need a Stoplight account to use basic Elements. 

How you chose to work with Elements depends on what you are trying to do.

- **[Elements](getting-started/elements/introduction.md)** - Only need documentation for your API reference? Integrate Elements with any Content Management System, existing documentation portal, website, or React application.
- **[Elements Dev Portal](getting-started/dev-portal/introduction.md)** - Need a full documentation portal combining articles and guides with your API reference? Integrate Elements Dev Portal using ReactJS or HTML.

The free plan offers many features and there's no need to figure out deployments. If your API description documents are in a Git repo, connect it to Stoplight to render your documentation when commits are pushed or merged.
