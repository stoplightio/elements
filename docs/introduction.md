# Introduction to Elements

Elements is a collection of UI components for displaying beautiful developer documentation using an OpenAPI document or a Stoplight project. Elements can be used in any website or project that supports HTML or React.

# âš  Elements v6 is discontinued

*Stoplight Elements v6* is **not supported** and is in maintenance mode only. This was a limited release for a select group of customers, but we're working on an awesome new open-source version which will be out soon. Sign up for [early-access here](https://stoplight.io/open-source/elements/)!
