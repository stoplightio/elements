# Stoplight Elements

Elements is an API Documentation toolkit, leveraging [OpenAPI](https://openapis.org/) and Markdown ([CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)) to provide beautiful, interactive API reference documentation, that you can integrate with any existing content-management system or single-page application. 

Elements is made by [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=elements&utm_campaign=readme), which offers hosted documentation, visual API design tools, and all sorts of other handy API tooling, but you do not need a Stoplight account to use Elements. If you are an API developer you can use Elements via the command-line, Web Components, or one of our various integrations with [popular JavaScript frameworks](getting-started/2-integrations/). 

## Free Hosted Docs

If you don’t want to host your own documentation, and don’t need to embed the docs into an existing site, consider using [Stoplight Documentation](https://stoplight.io/api-documentation/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=elements&utm_campaign=readme), which is basically hosted Elements. 

The free plan will get you a long way, and there's no need to figure out deployments. If your API description documents are in a Git repo, connect that to Stoplight and it will render your documentation for you whenever commits are pushed or merged.
